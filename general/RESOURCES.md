# Resources

These are the internet resources that I've found immensely useful while working
on my RX-7. Unfortunately, many forum post links these days point to long gone
websites; so for this reason I've included [Wayback
Machine](https://archive.org/web/) links with each, should they also disappear.

Because I am uncertain on licensing, I will not be hosting any of these
resources directly; I suggest you make a copies of PDFs for yourself!
